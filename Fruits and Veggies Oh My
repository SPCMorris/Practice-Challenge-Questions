/*The program that manages the stores prices has a bug and mixed up all the fruit prices with the vegetable prices. 
The prices were swapped by fruits that share the first letter with a vegetable.

For example, {Apple: $12}, {Asparagus: $6}

Here is what the prices should be: 

Apple: $6
Asparagus: $12
Cabbage: $1
Cantaloupe: $5
Bok Choy: $5
Beans: $2

Fruits: Apple, Cantaloupe and Beans
Vegetables: Asparagus, Cabbage, Bok Choy

The below var prices is what the program logs. There is only one of each, fruit and vegetable, that share the same first letter.
Please put the fruits with fruits, the vegetables with vegetables and fix all pricing!*/

//Fix me!
var prices = {
  Fruits: {
    Beans: $5,
    Apple: $12,
    Cabbage: $5
  },
  Vegetables: {
    Asparagus: $6,
    Cantaloupe: $1,
    BokChoy: $2
  }
};
